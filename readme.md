This is a simple script used for to a selection of generative linework drawings using [canvas-sketch by Matt DesLauriers](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch). I have been playing around and tweaking it for quite some time and felt I should clean it and up and share it.

It works by simply creating a grid of lines and then using noise to moduate the vertical positions of points in each line. Extra functionality is included to change the colour of the lines, apply a circular mask and select a randomized colour palette.

If youre looking to try it be sure to install canvas-sketch, chaikin-smooth and nice-palettes from npm before doing so.

heres a few sample pieces:
